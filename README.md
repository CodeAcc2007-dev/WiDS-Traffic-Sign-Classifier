# WiDS-Traffic-Sign-Classifier
Building a CNN model to classify traffic signs for autonomous vehicle perception as part of WiDS 5.0, IIT Bombay.

# Project Progress — Week-by-Week

This document summarizes the week-by-week progress of the project, including data preparation, model design, training, and evaluation.

## Week 1 — Python Fundamentals & Environment Setup
- **Environment:** Set up development environments using Google Colab and Kaggle.
- **Learning:** Mastered basic Python syntax (variables, lists, functions).
- **Practice:** Solved algorithmic problems (e.g., Two Sum) to improve logical problem solving.

## Week 2 — Machine Learning Foundations & Pandas
- **Theory:** Studied Linear Regression, cost functions, and gradient descent.
- **Data Handling:** Used Pandas for data cleaning and manipulation (useful for datasets such as GTSRB).
- **Neural Networks:** Explored TensorFlow Playground to visualize weight and bias adjustments.

## Week 3 — From Theory to Code (Data Preprocessing)
- **Image Processing:** Used Pillow (PIL) and NumPy to load ~50,000+ images and resize them to a uniform $30 \times 30$ resolution.
- **Normalization:** Scaled pixel values by dividing by `255.0`.
- **Data Splitting:** Created a validation split (20%) using `train_test_split` to monitor performance on unseen data.
